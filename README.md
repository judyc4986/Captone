## Project Overview

As of December 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy reported 3.55 million registered EVs nationwide, with Washington State recording 199,000 BEV registrations by mid-2025. This project assesses future growth by examining:

- Population and vehicle ownership trends by county
- Travel patterns and corridor demand
- Existing charging infrastructure and coverage gaps
- Policy incentives and vehicle density trends

## Objectives

1. Map existing Tesla Supercharger and public charging stations in Washington.
2. Estimate infrastructure needs based on demographic data.
3. Propose investments to meet forecasted demand.
4. Use machine learning to predict the relationship between infrastructure expansion and EV adoption.

## Methodology

The project combines demographic analysis, infrastructure mapping, and predictive modeling to recommend strategies for strengthening Washingtonâ€™s charging network.

## Dataset

- **EV Registration Data:** 199,000 VIN population of BEV registrations in Washington.
- **Charging Infrastructure:** Locations of the Supercharger network in the U.S. and Washington.
- **Demographic Data:** Census data by county, age, and year in Washington.
